# Workforce Analytics: Understanding and Reducing Employee Attrition

## Executive Summary
This project analyses employee-level workforce data to understand the key factors driving employee attrition and to identify patterns associated with higher retention risk.

The objective is to support **data-driven HR and management decisions** by translating workforce data into clear insights around employee behaviour, engagement, and organisational risk.

---

## Business Context
Employee attrition is costly, disruptive, and often preventable.  
Understanding *why* employees leave and *where* attrition risk is concentrated enables organisations to:

- Improve retention strategies  
- Reduce hiring and onboarding costs  
- Protect institutional knowledge  
- Support workforce planning and performance management  

This project focuses on analytical insight rather than assumptions, using data to highlight actionable risk drivers.

---

## Analytical Questions
The analysis is guided by questions such as:

1. What proportion of employees leave the organisation, and how does this vary by role and department?
2. Which factors show the strongest association with attrition?
3. How do compensation, tenure, and performance relate to employee turnover?
4. Are there specific job roles or demographic groups with elevated attrition risk?
5. What patterns emerge across satisfaction, workload, and career progression indicators?

## Dataset Overview
- **Source:** Employee workforce dataset
- **Level:** Individual employee records
- **Features:** Demographics, job role, tenure, compensation, performance metrics, and attrition status

The dataset reflects typical real-world HR data, including mixed variable types and categorical features.

---

## Data Preparation
Key preparation steps included:

- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Encoding categorical variables for analysis
- Creating derived features such as tenure bands
- Validating attrition labels and distributions
- Ensuring analysis-ready structure before exploration

---

## Methodology
The project follows a structured analytics workflow:

1. Data understanding and validation  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Group-wise and comparative analysis  
4. Identification of attrition drivers and risk patterns  
5. Synthesis of insights for decision-making  

Visualisations were selected to support interpretability and comparison.

---

## Key Insights
Key findings from the analysis include:

- Attrition rates vary significantly across job roles and departments
- Employees with lower tenure show higher likelihood of leaving
- Compensation and job satisfaction exhibit strong relationships with attrition
- Certain roles combine high workload with lower satisfaction, increasing risk
- Attrition risk is not evenly distributed and can be targeted with focused interventions

## Tools & Techniques
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualisation:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Analytics:** Exploratory Data Analysis, group comparisons  
- **Practices:** Data validation, clear documentation
